    "\n",
    "Lasso is the valuable technique for feature selection and regularization.\n",
    "It involves a penalty factor that determines how many features are retained; using cross-validation and it effectively shrinks less important features to zero, improving model interpretability and reducing overfitting."

    "Ridge Regression is often preferred when you have many features with small to medium effects, whereas Lasso Regression is useful when you suspect that only a subset of the features are truly important, or when you want a more interpretable model with feature selection capabilities.\n",
    "Ridge Regression tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero, but it rarely sets them exactly to zero whereas, Lasso Regression can shrink coefficients towards zero as well, but it has the added property of performing automatic feature selection by setting some coefficients exactly to zero."

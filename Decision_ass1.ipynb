    "Importance of Precision: High precision means that when an email is classified as spam, it is very likely to be truly spam. This is crucial because marking important, non-spam emails (false positives) as spam can result in users missing important information, leading to frustration and potential loss of critical communication.\n",
    "Reason: Users can tolerate some spam in their inbox (false negatives) but are highly sensitive to important emails being incorrectly flagged as spam (false positives).\n",

    "Reason: The consequences of false negatives (missing a cancer diagnosis) are far more severe than false positives (initially misdiagnosing healthy patients, who can undergo further testing to confirm).\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, Ridge Regression can indirectly perform feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero.\n",
    "While it doesn't inherently eliminate features like some other methods such as Lasso Regression, it effectively reduces the impact of less relevant features on the model's predictions.So, while Ridge Regression doesn't explicitly select features, it can still aid in feature selection by reducing the influence of less relevant predictors."

    "Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity happens when predictor exhibit a correlation among themselves. Ridge regression aims at reducing the standard error by adding some bias in the estimates of the regression. The reduction of error in regression estimates significantly, increases the reliability of the estimates.\n",
    "Although multicollinearity does not affect the regression estimates, it makes them vague, imprecise, and unreliable."

    "Q1. Explain the concept of precision and recall in the context of classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision and recall are metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions (both true positives and false positives). High precision indicates that most of the positive predictions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives (true positives and false negatives). High recall indicates that most of the actual positives are correctly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "where TP is true positives, FP is false positives, and FN is false negatives."

    "Q2. What is the F1 score? How is it different from precision and recall?\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score is a metric that combines precision and recall into a single value to balance the trade-off between the two. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "It differs from precision and recall in that it considers both metrics simultaneously. While precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and recall focuses on the ability to capture all positive instances, the F1 score provides a balance between them, especially useful when you need to find a compromise between precision and recall."

    "Q3. What is ROC and AUC, and how are they used to evaluate the performance of classification models?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC Curve: It is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a classification model by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR or Recall) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The TPR is on the y-axis, and the FPR is on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC (Area Under the Curve): It represents the area under the ROC curve. The AUC value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better-performing model. \n",
    "USAGE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve helps visualize the trade-off between sensitivity (recall) and specificity (1 - FPR) across different thresholds.\n",
    "The AUC provides a single scalar value to compare the overall performance of models; the higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes."

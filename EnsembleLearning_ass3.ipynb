    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees. This approach helps to reduce overfitting, improve predictive accuracy, and increase the robustness of the model by leveraging the strength of multiple weak learners."

    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Averaging: By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees, the model reduces variance, leading to more stable and generalizable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Subsets: Each tree is trained on a different random subset of the data (using bootstrap sampling) and a random subset of features, ensuring that the trees are less correlated and more diverse, which further mitigates overfitting."

    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging their individual outputs. Each tree in the forest makes its prediction for a given input, and the final prediction is the mean of all these individual predictions, which helps to reduce variance and improve the model's overall accuracy."

    "Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by averaging multiple models trained on different random subsets of the data. This process decreases the variance by ensuring that individual trees' errors, which might be due to noise in the data, are averaged out, leading to a more robust and generalized model."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging offers the advantage of allowing many weak learners to combine efforts to outdo a single strong learner. It also helps in the reduction of variance, hence eliminating the overfitting of models in the procedure. One disadvantage of bagging is that it introduces a loss of interpretability of a model."

    "Q3. How does the choice of base learner affect the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "In bagging, the choice of base learner significantly impacts the bias-variance tradeoff:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-bias base learners (e.g., decision stumps): Bagging can help reduce variance but may not significantly lower the bias, as the base learners are inherently simple and tend to underfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-bias, high-variance base learners (e.g., deep decision trees): Bagging is more effective in this scenario, as it reduces the variance substantially without increasing bias, leading to improved overall performance and better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, using low-bias, high-variance base learners in bagging generally results in the most substantial performance gains."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: Bagging creates multiple versions of the training dataset, trains a classifier on each, and aggregates their predictions typically through majority voting. This reduces variance and improves accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression: Bagging similarly trains multiple models on resampled datasets but aggregates their predictions by averaging the outputs, which smooths the predictions and reduces variance."

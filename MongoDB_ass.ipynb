    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, differ from traditional relational databases (SQL databases) in the following ways:\n",
    "1.Non-relational databases can use a variety of data models, including document, key-value, column-family, and graph models.\n",
    "2.They often do not require a fixed schema, allowing for more flexibility in storing and modifying data.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB offers several powerful features that make it a popular choice for modern applications. Here are some of its key features explained in short:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Document-Oriented Storage:\n",
    "MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for rich, hierarchical data structures similar to JSON.\n",
    "Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, enabling flexibility in data storage and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability and High Performance:\n",
    "MongoDB supports sharding, which distributes data across multiple servers, enhancing performance and storage capacity.\n",
    "Designed to handle high write and read operations efficiently, making it suitable for large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Flexible Schema:\n",
    "MongoDB allows for schema changes without requiring downtime, making it easy to adapt to changing application requirements.\n",
    "Supports a variety of query types, enabling dynamic and flexible data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Indexing:\n",
    "Provides support for various types of indexes, including single field, compound, geospatial, text, and hashed indexes, to improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "Powerful Data Aggregation: Offers a robust framework for data aggregation and transformation, allowing complex data processing and analysis within the database."

    "Example: In a Car class, attributes like brand, model, color, and speed are encapsulated within the class. They are accessed and modified through getter and setter methods, ensuring controlled access to the internal state of the car. For instance, the speed attribute may be private, and the accelerate() method would be responsible for updating it based on user input."

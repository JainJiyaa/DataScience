    "one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV are both methods for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning, but they differ in how they explore the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "Grid Search CV:\n",
    "Method: Exhaustively searches through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space. It evaluates all possible combinations of the hyperparameters provided in the grid.\n",
    "Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "Method: Samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations from a specified distribution or list, rather than evaluating all possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose One Over the Other:\n",
    "Grid Search CV: Choose this when you have a relatively small number of hyperparameters and their possible values, and you can afford the computational cost. It is suitable when you need the most precise hyperparameter tuning within a well-defined grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search CV: Choose this when you have a large hyperparameter space or limited computational resources. It is useful for getting good results more quickly, especially when dealing with complex models or large datasets. It is also beneficial when you want to explore a broader range of hyperparameters without the computational expense of evaluating every possible combination."

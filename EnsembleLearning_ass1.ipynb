    "Q1. What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "An ensemble technique in machine learning combines multiple models to improve overall performance and robustness compared to using a single model. This approach leverages the strengths of different models to reduce errors, enhance accuracy, and mitigate overfitting. Common ensemble methods include bagging (e.g., Random Forest), boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), and stacking."

    "Q2. Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning to improve predictive performance, increase robustness, and reduce the risk of overfitting. By combining multiple models, ensembles can leverage the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of individual models, leading to more accurate and reliable results."

    "Q3. What is bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique in machine learning that improves model accuracy by training multiple versions of a model on different random subsets of the training data and then aggregating their predictions, typically by averaging or voting. This helps reduce variance and prevent overfitting."

    "Q4. What is boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning that sequentially trains multiple models, each focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessor. By combining these models, usually through weighted voting or averaging, boosting enhances the overall accuracy and performance, particularly for weak learners."

    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are not always better than individual models. While they often improve performance and robustness, they can also be more complex, computationally expensive, and harder to interpret. Additionally, for some problems or datasets, a well-tuned single model may perform as well as or better than an ensemble."

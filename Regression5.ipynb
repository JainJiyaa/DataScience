    "\n",
    "Elastic net linear regression uses the penalties from both the lasso and ridge techniques to regularize regression models. \n",
    "It is different as it can handle multicollinearity, reduce overfitting, and select relevant features. "

    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "ElasticNet Regression is a versatile tool that offers a robust way to handle complex datasets with multicollinearity and high dimensionality. Its ability to perform feature selection and manage the bias-variance trade-off makes it a valuable algorithm for many machine learning tasks.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "ElasticNet can be computationally expensive on large datasets due to the need to tune the model.\n",
    "The selection of tuning parameters (alpha and lambda) can be tricky, as there is no definitive way to choose these parameters."

    "Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "By imputing missing values that is KNN, Multiple imputation, Mean-Median imputation and possibly using indicator variables, you ensure that Elastic Net Regression can be applied effectively without losing valuable information from incomplete data and Some machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) offer models that can handle missing values internally."
